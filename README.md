COSC 112: PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
Calendar App – Dasha Asienga, Priya Bakshi, and Lynca Kaminka
Describe your program at a high level
Our program is a calendar application that allows users to keep track of activities and duties that
they need to do. Their information is stored in a file, such that every time the user launches the
app, they are able to retrieve any items or information that they had added previously as well as
add new ones. They are also able to delete entries. Because they are able to access previous
entries, our calendar app also includes a “to-do-list” feature and a “reminder” feature for
activities that are coming up. They are able to select how they view the calendar, that is, on a
daily or monthly template. We allow different users to use the calendar as well as change their
calendar display (theme).
